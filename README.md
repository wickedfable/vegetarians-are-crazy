Vegetarians Are Crazy - Bukkit Plugin
=====================

## Introduction
If you are playing as a vegetarian in Minecraft, especially in vanilla survival mode (read: no mods), there is not much consideration for your needs (oh how I long for a piece of cake). That's okay, though, it's a game and you are the one that chooses to play it that way so some concessions have to be made. For the most part, you can get around a lot of the limitations of starting out as a vegetarian. For example, where non-vegetarian players have easy access to food via punching poor pigs and cows, you can kill a few skeletons (assuming you are not also a pacifist Minecraftian) and then make bonemeal from their bones to instantly grow crops for food. Of course you still will not have quick access to armor which is another important thing to have in survival mode among other problems (you cannot punch a few sheep to quickly make a bed, for example), but all of that is just part of the game. 

Unfortunately, though, you are closed off from some of the more interesting features of Minecraft - namely the enchanting system. With the release of Minecraft 1.3, books now require a piece of leather to be made. Books, of course, lead to the creation of bookshelves and, more importantly, enchanting tables. As a remedy to this, Vegetarians Are Crazy is a Bukkit plugin that makes certain, specific recipes friendly to vegetarians while attempting to preserve gameplay balance. For now, the focus of the plugin is mainly aimed at books and item frames, but further items will be made vegetarian-friendly in the future (can you say faux-leather armor?).

## Notes
* A functioning Bukkit server is required for this plugin to work. It is a server-side mod not a client-side one so it cannot be applied to single-player Minecraft.
* The plugin is being tested in Bukkit version 1.4.2-R0.3 - functionality in previous versions of Bukkit is not guaranteed.
* This is an extremely simple plugin but I have very little programming experience. If there are any kinks, they have yet to be worked out as the plugin is only in its initial stages of development.
* Vegetarians Are Crazy is not meant to make playing Minecraft as a vegetarian any easier, it simply gives you alternative options to pursue the same features that non-vegetarian players have access to. In many cases it is more challenging to pursue the vegetarian-friendly version of a recipe than the normal one, but that might actually make it more fun!
* Gameplay balance and some semblance of realism is an aim of the plugin. To that end, some research has been done to ensure that the alternative recipes are not imbalanced and the substitutes used have at least a partial rooting in real-life vegetarian alternative ingredients.

## Installation
Place the "vegetariansarecrazy.jar" file into your Bukkit server's "Plugins" folder then start or restart your server. A message should appear in the console telling you that the plugin is active. You are now set! Go make vegetarian-friendly books and item frames!

## Crafting
For the most part, these vegetarian-friendly recipes will follow the same guidelines as the original recipes, unless otherwise noted. This means that most recipes will simply substitute one ingredient for another and also follow the same crafting method. By "crafting method" I am referring to whether an item has a shapeless or shaped recipe. Shapeless recipes means an item can be crafted by putting the ingredients into the crafting squares in any order you wish. Shaped recipes require ingredients to be arranged in a specific shape in order to produce the proper item.
